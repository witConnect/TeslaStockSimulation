# Tesla Stock Simulation

Analyzing and simulating the price of Tesla Stock data for the period 2010 to 2020 using basic Python visualisations

## DOMAIN AND MOTIVATION

The Work will help one to understand the growth of stocks and whether to invest or not. It will also give one a idea of the profit one will attain as well as the market risks involved.

## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

On the analysis of the data one gets to know:

- Whether one can get profit by buying the stocks?
- Will the profit of buying will increase?
- What is the risk on investing?
- Which was the best period of time to invest?
- Average profit to loss ratio
- Average volume of shares sold every day

## TECHNIQUES

- Plotting -  to visualize the data and see trend of growth in the share of stocks
- Bar Graphs - to find the lowest and highest stocks, as well as to see the consistency in growth

## Monte Carlo Simulation for Stock Price

- It is used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables.
- Daily Return = ln(Daysâ€™s Price/ Previous Day Price)
- N number of trials is conducted for predefined number of days
- The Price for a particular day has a great chance in lying between the lowest price projected and the highest price projected.
- For example 50th day from the last date the Price has a chance of ending between 500 and 1500 (Image in Monte-Carlo Folder)
